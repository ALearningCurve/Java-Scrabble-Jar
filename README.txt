This a Scrabble Game that I made in Java. It uses JavaFX and is a single player game.
In order to run it, you only need to run the jar, though in order to play a blank you need
To run the file from the terminal with the command $ java -jar Scrabble_Game.jar

	Thanks for playing and have a good day!
